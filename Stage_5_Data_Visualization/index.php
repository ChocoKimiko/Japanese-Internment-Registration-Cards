                                    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                                    <p>In the Second World War, the Empire of Japan occupied the former Dutch colony called the Dutch East Indies, now known as Indonesia, from March 1942 until August 1945. 
                                        Several months thereafter Indonesia declares independence. 
                                        The Japanese occupation is amongst the most severe periods in the entire Indonesian history. 
                                        Originally, the Dutch East Indies had been controlled by the Dutch ever since the year 1816. 
                                        Nevertheless, due to the fact that during the Japanese occupation, the Netherlands itself was also colonized by Germany, 
                                        the Dutch force had insufficient manpower to win against the Japanese army. 
                                        So, it took the Japanese army and navy only three months after the attack on British Borneo 
                                        to overran the Dutch along with the alliance forces. 
                                        The Japanese occupation was a major challenge to the Dutch in Indonesia and therefore the 
                                        Dutch colonial rule was officially ended and had been replaced by the Japanese colonial rule. 
                                        Approximately 100.000 Dutch civilians were arrested and imprisoned in concentration- and prisoner-of-war camps. 
                                        The experience for most prisoners in the internment camps was agonizing. 
                                        They had to endure and suffer from among other things doing physical labor,
                                        unjustified execution, sex slavery, and torture. 
                                        The living conditions in the camps were inadequate, as there was a lack of sustenance and clothing. 
                                        Many prisoners died as a consequence of starvation, torments, and illness.</p>
